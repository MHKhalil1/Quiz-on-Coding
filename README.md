# Quiz-on-Coding

## Description
- I started by using many <divs> to allow myself to create functions through Javascript.
- I carried on by jumping to Javascript and added all the important "var".
- I implemented a function to allow my questions and choices to appear.
- I added a function to display the screen before the quiz and during the quiz.
- I added an array to allow my questions to be shuffled when starting the quiz.
- I added eventListeners allowing a single click to take a user to the next step.
